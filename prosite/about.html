    <h1>Our Story</h1>

    <p>Mountain Bean Café was founded when we noticed many hikers struggled to find fresh, quality coffee during their adventures. The problem was clear: mountain visitors needed a reliable spot to recharge and enjoy freshly roasted coffee.</p>

    <p>Our promise was simple — to deliver freshly roasted, delicious coffee right in the heart of Colorado’s mountain trails. We craft every batch with care, inviting you to experience the true flavor of the Rockies.</p>
